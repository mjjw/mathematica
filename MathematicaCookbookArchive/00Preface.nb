If you were stranded on a desert island with only your laptop (and presumably \
a large solar panel) what software would you want to have with you? For me \
the answer definitely includes that latest version of Wolfram Mathematica. \
Whether you are a scientist, engineer, mathematician, Wall Street quant, \
statistician, programmer, or even artist or musician, you will be a better \
one if you have this tool at your disposal. Of course, having a tool and \
knowing how to use it well are quite different things. That is why I wrote \

I am a big fan of O'Reilly Cookbooks. These books are designed to help you \
solve real world problems. Mathematica is an ideal candidate for a cookbook \
because it is so vast, deep and full of traps for the novice. I was ecstatic \
to learn that O'Reilly was looking to publish a Mathematica Cookbook and even \
more excited when I was chosen to be its author. I have been a user of \
Mathematica since version 3.0. Although that was over 13 years ago, I still \
remember the frustration of trying to solve problems in this system. I don't \
mean this in a derogatory way. The frustration  a newbie experiences  when \
trying to learn Mathematica comes from the knowledge that you are sitting in \
front of a highly advanced computational platform that is eventually going to \
magnify your productivity tenfold if you can only wrap your mind around its \
unfamiliar idioms. If you are a new (or even not so new) user of Mathematica \
today you are simultaneously in a better and much worse position than I was \
in version 3.0. You are in a better position because Mathematica 7.0 is \
vastly more powerful than 3.0 was back then. Not only have the number of \
available functions doubled but Mathematica has fundamental new capabilities \
including dynamic interactivity, curated data sources, parallel processing, \
image processing and much more. You are in a worse position because there is \
much more to learn! However, as Mathematica grows it largely remains \
unchanged in its core principles.  \

This book is designed to help you master Mathematica's core principles by \
presenting it in the context of real world problems. However, my goal was not \
just to show you how to solve problems in Mathematica but to show you how to \
do so in a way that plays to Mathematica's strengths. This means there is an \
emphasis on symbolic, functional and pattern-based styles of programming. \
Mathematica is a multi-paradigm programming language. You can easily write \
code in it that a Fortran or C programmer would have little trouble \
following. However, the procedural style that this entails is not likely to \
give you good performance. More importantly, it will often cause you to write \
more code than necessary and spend more time adapting that code to future \
problems. Stephen Wolfram has said that a correct Mathematica program is \
often a short Mathematica program. There is much truth to this. The truth \
come from the idea that good Mathematica programs leverage the capabilities \
of the vast library of both general purpose and highly specialized functions \
that are built-in. Programming in Mathematica is a search for the right \
combination of primitives. My hope is that this Cookbook will play a role as \
your guide.\

The Mathematica Cookbook is not necessarily meant to be read from start to \
finish like a conventional book (although you are certainly welcome to do \
so!). Having said that, the chapters are organized in a purposefully way. \
Chapters 1 through 8 present general techniques that all users of Mathematica \
should know. These chapters are largely self contained but sometimes it is \
necessary to use features in one chapter that are covered more deeply in \
another. Cross-references within each recipe as well as a function recipe \
cross reference at the start of the book should prevent you from getting \
stuck. However, keep in mind that a cookbook is not the same as a tutorial \
and you should also make frequent use of the Mathematica reference, tutorials \
and guides that are integrated into Mathematica's help system. Chapters 9 \
through 14 cover specific domains of Mathematica application. If you are the \
type of person who learns best by examples from your area of expertise, you \
will benefit from seeing the techniques of the first chapters leveraged in \
problems related to physics, engineering, calculus, statistics, music, \
finance and more. Finally, chapters 15 through 19 cover important techniques, \
extensions and tools that make Mathematica unrivaled as a technical software \
development tool. \

 " covers numerics. For the most part, Mathematica simply does the right \
thing when computing numeric results as you would expect. In pure mathematics \
numbers are formal objects that are well behaved but when you represent \
numbers in a finite discrete device like a computer you will often need to \
understand issues of precision and accuracy in order to get reasonable \
results on certain classes of problems. Further, numbers have different \
representations in Mathematica (Integers, Rationals, Complex and some exotic \
types like Intervals). Then there is an issue of input and presentation. \
Mathematica supports different base representations and different display \
formats. This chapter has recipes that cover all these issues and it is wise \
to have some familiarity with them before using any of the numeric \
algorithms.\n\nFunctional programming is a style of Mathematica development \
that most seasoned users prefer. ",
 StyleBox["Chapter 2", "Emphasis"],
 " dives deeply into Functional Programming, Mathematica style. Because \
Mathematica was designed to support multiple development paradigms, its \
functional programming abilities are not as pure as languages like Haskell. \
This is actually a big plus because if you are using Mathematica chance are \
you are solving a problem and its the solution rather than the aesthetics \
that are foremost in your mind. Mathematica programmers prefer the functional \
style because it leads to efficient programs. It also leads to elegant \
programs. In the context of programming, elegant means the combination of \
brevity, power and clarity. There is amazing sense of intellectual \
satisfaction that come form finding a concise functional solution and this \
feeling creates the positive feedback that will draw you into Mathematica. \
However, this style is often mysterious to people who come to Mathematica \
from other languages like Fortran, C, Mathlab or Microsoft Excel. I think \
this chapter will help you discover the rewards of the functional style."
